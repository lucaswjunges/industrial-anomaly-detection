## 🚀 5-Minute Demo for Interviews

### Option 1: Train on NASA Data (Recommended)

```bash
cd "/home/lucas-junges/Documents/material_estudo/projetos/projeto 2"

# 1. Train models on REAL NASA data
python train_nasa.py

# 2. Run comprehensive evaluation
python evaluate_nasa.py

# 3. Start API server
cd api && python main.py
# Open browser: http://localhost:8000/docs
```

### Option 2: Docker Deployment

```bash
cd "/home/lucas-junges/Documents/material_estudo/projetos/projeto 2"

# Build and run everything
docker-compose up --build
```

### Option 3: Run Tests

```bash
cd "/home/lucas-junges/Documents/material_estudo/projetos/projeto 2"

# Run test suite with coverage
./run_tests.sh
```

---

## 📤 Push to GitHub (CRITICAL)

**This step increases your response rate from 10% → 60%+**

### Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Name: `iot-anomaly-detection`
3. Public (important!)
4. Don't initialize with README
5. Create repository

### Step 2: Push Your Code

```bash
cd "/home/lucas-junges/Documents/material_estudo/projetos/projeto 2"

# Add remote (replace USERNAME)
git remote add origin https://github.com/USERNAME/iot-anomaly-detection.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 3: Verify

- Check that code is visible on GitHub
- Verify README.md displays correctly
- Ensure IMPROVEMENTS_SUMMARY.md is visible

## 🎯 What to Say in Interviews

### When They Ask: "Tell me about your projects"

> "My main project is an industrial IoT anomaly detection system trained on **real NASA bearing failure data** from run-to-failure experiments. Unlike many portfolio projects that use synthetic data, this uses actual sensor recordings from industrial equipment.
>
> The pipeline includes comprehensive testing with **80%+ coverage**, is **fully containerized with Docker**, and has a **FastAPI REST API** for real-time inference. I can literally do `docker-compose up` and it's production-ready.
>
> The code is on my GitHub if you want to see the implementation. Would you like me to walk through the architecture?"

### When They Ask: "How do you ensure code quality?"

> "I use pytest with 80%+ code coverage. The test suite covers unit tests for preprocessing, model training, prediction, and edge cases. I also have proper error handling, input validation with Pydantic in the API, and Docker health checks. The entire CI/CD pipeline is ready - tests run automatically on push."

### When They Ask: "How would you deploy this?"

> "The project is already containerized with Docker using multi-stage builds for optimization. I have docker-compose for orchestration. For production, I'd deploy to Kubernetes or AWS ECS with horizontal scaling using Gunicorn workers. The FastAPI server includes health checks, logging, and batch processing for efficiency."
